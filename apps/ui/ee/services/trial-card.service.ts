// One free trial per card, not per workspace. `workspaces.trial_ends_at` only ever gated the
// workspace it sits on, so a new signup was a new trial and a new Box: twelve of them in six days,
// two of which came from the very same card.
//
// The refusal only applies while isTrialCardReuseBlocked() says so. With it off, the card is still
// recorded and every trial goes through.
//
// A card that has already spent its trial gets the subscription cancelled, not billed. The trial is
// paid by a SetupIntent, so at this point nothing has been charged yet and cancelling costs the
// person nothing. Billing them instead was defensible on the fraud cluster and indefensible on the
// one person with one card and two workspaces, who clicked a button reading "Start free trial"
// under a line promising they would not be charged. That is a chargeback we would lose.
//
// Returns null when the trial was refused: there is no subscription left to sync, and the caller
// must not run applySubscriptionToWorkspace on it. That ordering matters more than it looks: a
// `trialing` sync would post the "your trial started" receipt (which lifecycle_emails then refuses
// to ever re-send), freeze trial_ends_at on a date a week out, and pin the budget to the trial cap.
//
// The workspace keeps `trial_ends_at`, so its next checkout carries no trial and the billing dialog
// already says so ("Your free trial has been used. Billed today, cancel anytime."). Subscribing for
// real stays one click away, this time with the price in front of them.
//
// Nothing here throws. The webhook event carries the workspace's whole entitlement, not just this
// check, so a hiccup on Stripe's side must not 500 into a retry loop and leave a paying customer
// locked out. The card simply stays unrecorded, and cloud/packages/cloud/scripts/audit-trial-card-reuse.ts records it
// cold afterwards.
